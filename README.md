# BadhoAssesment
This React Native/Expo app uses the Rick and Morty GraphQL API to fetch and display character data. The app features a card-based layout with images and details such as ID, name, status, species, and gender. The data is fetched using Apollo Client and rendered using the FlatList component. The cards are styled with CSS to create a visually appealing spread-over-the-page design. Also i've deployed the project in expo.dev so each build will be refected in the expo mobile app and created the aab file for the same.
